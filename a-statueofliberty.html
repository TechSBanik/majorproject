            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Statue of Liberty, a symbol of freedom and democracy, is located on Liberty Island in New York
                Harbor. A gift from France, it was dedicated on October 28, 1886, and has since become an iconic
                landmark of the United States.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The statue was designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave
                Eiffel. It was presented to the United States to commemorate the centennial of the American Declaration
                of Independence and as a symbol of friendship between the two nations.</p>

            <h2>Architecture and Features</h2>
            <p>The statue stands 305 feet tall and is made of copper. It depicts a robed female figure representing
                Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, holding a torch in her right hand and a tablet inscribed with
                the date of American independence in her left.</p>

            <h2>Tourism</h2>
            <p>Visitors can take a ferry to Liberty Island and explore the pedestal, museum, and observation deck. The
                nearby Ellis Island Immigration Museum provides further historical context about America's immigration
                history.</p>
