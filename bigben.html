            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London. The term is often extended to refer to both the clock and the clock tower, officially known as Elizabeth Tower.</p>
            
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Completed in 1859, Big Ben was designed by Augustus Pugin. It has since become one of the most prominent symbols of the United Kingdom and British parliamentary democracy.</p>
            
            <h2>Architecture and Features</h2>
            <p>The tower stands 316 feet (96 meters) tall and has a clock face with a diameter of 23 feet (7 meters). The bell itself weighs over 13 tons and chimes every hour.</p>
            
            <h2>Tourism</h2>
            <p>Although the tower is not open to the public for tours, visitors can admire it from the outside and explore nearby attractions such as the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey.</p>
